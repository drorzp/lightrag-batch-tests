This Node.js script tests the LightRAG API by reading data from a CSV file, making API calls, and checking if the expected file name appears in the response.

## Features

- For each row, tests three different queries (easy, medium, and hard)
- Checks if the file_name from the CSV appears in each API response
- Writes test results to a CSV file with detailed pass/fail information
